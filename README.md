# More Obnoxious.CSS

A "just add water" library of obnoxious CSS animations, based on the original [Obnoxious.CSS](http://tholman.com/obnoxious/) by [Tim Holman](http://tholman.com/), and inspired by the simplicity of [Animate.CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).

## About

I wanted to build a library of animations that were obnoxious, but not so obnoxious they could never be used.  I like to think there is a website out there that really needs text to blink un-evenly, or exit via a black hole.  If you happen to run one of these websites, please let me know - I would love to see it!

## The Path Forward

I feel like I've just begun to scratch the surface of obnoxious CSS animations.  There are a lot more possibilities, and my goal is to continue updating and refining the library.
